### What is TekanBoards? How is it different from Tekkan One?

TekanBoards is a generic kanban-like solution for managing "boards" "lists" and "cards", packaged as a Tiddlywiki5 plugin. The intent is to allow custom styles, buttons, and templates to extent the use beyond kanban-like project management.

Tekkan One is an all-in-one cross-platform Kanban solution that can be used offline. Tekkan One is aimed specifically at kanban-like project management, and was created using  <a href="http://tiddlywiki.com/" target="_blank">TW5</a>
